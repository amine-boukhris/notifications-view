*No fancy markup for this readme*

The project was fairly simple, a junior level, but I suck with react
I seperated it into three components, header, container, and card
the styling took a lot of space and time
I used typescript without messing everything up.
I am back to prettier
I didn't get the design exactly but it look good though, no hate
but I am not sure if my react practices are good, or need to be taken out immediately.
I learned a new thing, which is the @media (hover: <value>) of css that target devices with a hover mechanism.
I still don't understand what is the *.d.ts files, why use them, what problem do they solve etc.
I wonder if I should change index.js to index.ts , should search for this later
I find it a bit weird that the assets folder is in the src folder, thinking of it, shouldn't I use the public folder for assets??
I did include the modern-normalize css file and things seem to stay in the correct priority.
I don't plan to work with react for so long, maybe 6 more projects, big and small, then I will switch back to svelte or just use vanilla. I don't think I want to learn a new framework such as angular. but I plan to learn back end officially, not just watch some random videos, but see a full detailed course with different technologies like next.js etc.
